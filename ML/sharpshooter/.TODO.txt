From Summer Team:

To-do list for sharpshooter ML:
    - Optuna the UNet probe splitter, minimize overfitting
    - Full optuna on the probing UNet (only partial study has been done)
        - try to get access to a good GPU for this, some trainings were taking quite long (1.4hrs on RTX 4080/0.5hrs on 
          RTX 5090). maybe the Firebird Computing Cluster at Swarthmore?

    - Rework Optuna to save outputs to a SQLite database rather than the log txt file (it has built 
      in functionality for this) to not do trials with hyperparameters that have already been tested 
      before. This should allow Optuna studies to be started/stopped without losing progress.

    - Look at attention for the probing UNet bottleneck (maybe for probe splitter too if it makes it better)

    - Postprocessing - we implemented a simple rolling average to reduce barcoding, but the previous clinic team
      did more advanced postprocessing in their code. See if any of that can be adapted.

    - Eventually, Elaine/Auburn will get us new data from the new engineer's DR3 EPG board, which will be different
      form than what was trained on, so new models might need to be trained. 

    - Current models do not take into account the settings of the EPG board at each data point. Once this is incorporated
      into the new recording data, models might be able to take advantage of this.

    


OTHER NOTES:
    - data_quality_map.json is a map containing the qualities of each of the valid data files, found through manual inspection. 
      3 is best, and has lots of densely labeled regions. 0 is worst, and has no probing regions.
      There are notes about individual files in the google drive (Data/Sort Data document)

    - label_map.json maps the labels to 0 (non-probing label) or 1 (probing label)
