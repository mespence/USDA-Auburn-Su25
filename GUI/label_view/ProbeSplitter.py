        Input: recording: A pre-rectified mosquito recording as a 1-D nupmy 
                    array. Pre-rectified recordings are necessary as baseline is 
                    not 0 in post-rectified recordings.
                window: Before NP regions can be identified, a rolling
                    average filter is applied to remove noise in the NP regions.
                    window is the size of this filter in samples.
                threshold: The maximum value of an NP sample.
                min_probe_length: The minimum acceptable length of a probe in
                    samples.
                np_pad: the number of NP samples before and after each probe to
                    include. Note that high values might result in overlapping with
                    the next probe.
        Output: A list of (start sample, end sample) tuples for each probe. By 
                default contains about 5 seconds of NPs at the beginning and end            
                of each probe. We say "about" because this splitting is done
                in an unsupervised manner, although it is largely pretty good.
